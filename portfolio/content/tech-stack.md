# My Tech Stack

## Operating Systems

**Primary:** macOS (M1 MacBook Air)
**Secondary:** Linux - Ubuntu (UTM VM)

I'll always prefer the polished ecosystem and UNIX-based developer environment of macOS, but the various Linux distros are always a nice challenge. Virtualizing Ubuntu sacrifices some performance, but lets me practice my CLI skills and test packages cross-platform.

## Development Environment

**Code Editor:** VS Code, Cursor.sh, Zed
**Terminal:** iTerm2 + Oh My Zsh
**Package Managers:** Homebrew, Flatpak

I started — and will probably end — with VS Code, but Cursor's agentic AI beats Copilot by a mile, and Zed makes some interesting design decisions too. iTerm2 (and the ZSH shell) are by far the smartest choices on a Mac and I'd hate to work without them. I'd highly recommend installing everything you can with Homebrew, and avoiding the Snap store is always a safe bet with Flatpaks.

## Productivity Tools

**Notes:** Obsidian.MD, Apple Notes
**Calendar:** Apple Calendar (ICS)
**Task Management:** TickTick
**Password Manager:** Bitwarden

Obsidian is quite possibly the best power tool for lightweight note-taking I've ever used. The plugin ecosystem is an actual marvel, where I can run my code-snippets within a Markdown document, sync with Git, organize with data frames, and symlink concepts, lectures, and assignments. I haven't even begun to unlock its full potential, but I'm already impressed with how genuinely powerful it is.

I'm still heavily embedded in the Apple ecosystem with no intentions of escaping, so I'll occasionally write in the native apps when I'm not on Linux. TickTick has recommendations from some of the most reputable people in the tech space, and you don't need me to tout how versatile or efficient it is, but what I personally love is converting my task lists to time-blocked ICS files and importing into Apple Calendar.

Lastly, Bitwarden is free and open source, reliable, cross-platform software that truly "just works".

## Daily Applications

**Browser:** Arc Browser, Zen Browser
**PDF Viewer:** Apple Preview, Edge PDF
**Media:** Apple Music, IINA, Plex
**Communication:** Discord

So far, Arc is by far the best browser for actually managing a productive workspace of programming, hobbies, courses, and research. As soon as Zen Browser — the FOSS alternative built on Gecko — starts supporting some essential features and gains the polish and sophistication that makes Arc's organization just a genuine joy to use, I will happily switch away from Chromium. Until then, Arc remains unparalleled for productivity in every way, from its spaces and pinned tabs UI to my keyboard shortcuts and many nested folders.

I may be an Apple shill, but I'll maintain that their native PDF viewer can almost match Edge, and their Music client — at least when you're deep in the ecosystem — far surpasses the alternative. Of course, I self-host most of my media on a Plex server through a VM on the cloud that I port-forward and SSH into with some janky but working automated scripts. The rest is self-explanatory.

## Additional Tools

**Bookmarking:** Raindrop.io
**VPN:** Cloudflare WARP

Lastly, Raindrop is an (oft-neglected) must for saving anything useful that crosses any platform you browse, and Cloudflare — especially if you own a domain and can tunnel your traffic — is probably the best (RD-compatible) VPN, even if you only want a DNS change.
